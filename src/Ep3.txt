         Templates in Angular Components ( .html)

Template is nothing but an HTML file present in your component folder.
Templates are related in .ts file using templateURL

If you see any component.ts file then you will see the selector

      -selector -> "app-leads-listing"
      -unique identifier to identify this component
      - we call it like this <app-leads-listing>

styleURLs =[]
    --> it can have more than one url.

--Angular Directive
      Angular Directives are used to extend the power of the HTML by giving it new syntax
      --Component Directive
            Every angular application must have at least 1 component 
            Have its own Templates
            Events attached
      --Structural Directives
            Updates Structure
            ngFor,nglf,ngSwitch
      --Attribute Directives
            ngStyle,ngClass
      
      -------------Structural Directive----------------------------

Structural Directives are responsible for HTML layout. They shape or reshape DOM's structure by adding removing or manipulating elements

As with other directive we apply structural directive to host elements.
The directive then does whatever it supposed to do.

An (*) preceeds the directive attribute

----*ngIf - condition will evaluate the expression and result in true or false
                  ||  && !

            <div *ngIf="success_msg; then update_msg; else error_msg">

            </div>

            //// whre success_msg and update_msg are variables

-----*ngFor - similar to for statement in other programming languages
       Syntax:
            <div *ngFor="let ele of collection:></div>
            index - gets current index of the current element in iterations
            first - returns true if the current element is the first element 
            last - returns true if the current element is the last element 
            even - returns true if the current element is the even element 
            odd - returns true if the current element is the odd element 



ngSwitch
