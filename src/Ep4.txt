----------------------------- Data Binding -------------------------------------

Means to bind the data from view (Template) to Controller (Component Class)
Data binding as the name suggests interacting with data
Defines how data flows and how the data gets updated based on some business logic

Data is spread throughout all the 4 components file

Data transfer can be from template to component or from Component to Template
----------One Way Data binding
        -From component to template(view)
            1- Interpolation
                is a technique that allows the user to bind data from component to view
                can be used for integer,string,objects,arrays
                {{ variable_name }}
                   <h2>Book Name = {{bookName}}</h2>   String 
                   <h2>Pages = {{pages}}</h2>     Integer
                   <h2>Author = {{about.writer}}</h2> Object
            
            2- Property Binding
                is a technique that allows the user to bind properties of elements from Component to View 
                [property] = " "
                <div [innerHTML]="bookName"></div>

            3- Attribute Binding
                is a technique that allows us to bind attributes of elements from component to view(template)
                functionality is almost similar to property binding.
                Difference

                    [ngClass]="expression"  // property binding
                    [attr.className] = "c1"
                    some attributes are not natively supported for elements
                    -> [colspan]="colVal"  //error_msg
                    -> [attr.colspan]="colVal" //correct
                
                angular prefers property binding

                  or
        -From template to component
            -Event binding
                is a technique allows the user to bind the events of element from view/template to component
                can be used for all available event
                <button (event_name) = "function()"> Click Me </button> 
                        event is nothing but javascript event
                            -> onclick
                            ->onmousehover
                            ->onfocus
                            ->onblur
                    * do not write "on" before event
                    <button (click)="method()">Click</button>
                





----------Two Way Binding
        -Data flows from View to Component and Component to View
           Data from Template --> Component -->Template
        -Two Way data binding is the combination of 
            -> Alternative of writing ngModel
            -> Property Binding and Event Binding
            
            <input [value]="data1" (input)="$event.target.value" />
