Module consistes of:-
    -Declaration
        -All components relies There
    - Imports
        - We can import module inside module
    - Providers
        -Services that we need will be injected here 
    - Bootstrap
        -first component module should use
    - export
        -used to export coponent outside the module

Every angular application should have at least 1 module 

Ex.
    Contacts 
    Users
    Leads
    Opportunities
    Settings
    Profile
    Authentications

Free Users
    Contacts 
    Users
Premium Users
    Leads
    Opportunities
    Settings
    Profile

You can turn on or off modules as per requirement

Components

Components are the most important and basic building blocks of angular apps

Authentication Module:-
    -new-Users
    -login
    -forgot-password
    -reset-password
Components are the smallest functionality that you will implement in your application
It can have parent child relationship


Let's create some custom components.

-contact
    ng g component add-contact
    ng g component edit-contact
    ng g component list-contact
    ng g component view-contact

add-contact
    add-contact.html  ---> view html or template file
    add-contact.ts --> It is a class file contains logic
    add-contact.spec. --> It is having unit tests 
    add-contact.css --> styling 

component.ts file has

    selector--> unique identifier for the component(how will u refer to this component) 
    templateURL--> your html code
    styleURLs --> for linking component stylesheet
